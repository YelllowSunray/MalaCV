<p>Based on everything you've shared—and the way Mala sees, feels, and critiques the world—the <strong>problem she wants to focus upon</strong> is this:</p><p><strong>The Dehumanization of Systems</strong></p><p>Mala wants to address how modern systems—economic, corporate, social, and political—are built on <strong>extraction, inequality, and disconnection</strong>, leading to emotional, social, and ecological harm.</p><p>She is emotionally reacting to:</p><ul><li><strong>Systems that reward domination</strong> (patriarchy, weaponized power, performative meritocracy)</li><li><strong>Cultures that suppress emotional truth</strong> (shaming vulnerability, punishing rest, ignoring empathy)</li><li><strong>Workplaces that exploit instead of uplift</strong> (dog-eat-dog, burnout, people-as-machines)</li><li><strong>Societies that justify injustice as “how the world works”</strong> (e.g., Trumpian cruelty, Israel-Palestine grief)</li></ul><p>But underneath her complaints is this deeper <strong>mission</strong>:</p><p><strong>🌱 Her Core Purpose: Humanizing Systems</strong></p><p>To <strong>rebuild systems of work, learning, leadership, and community</strong>—so they:</p><ul><li>✨ Empower people, not extract from them</li><li>🧠 Integrate emotional intelligence, not suppress it</li><li>🤝 Celebrate inclusive collaboration, not winner-takes-all control</li><li>🌍 Respect the planet and people equally</li><li>🎶 Create joy-based engagement, not fear-driven compliance</li></ul><p><strong>🧩 Root Problem Framed Simply:</strong></p><p>“How can we design systems where <strong>people can grow and feel</strong>, not just survive and perform?”</p><p>This aligns beautifully with:</p><ul><li><strong>Deming’s root-cause view</strong> of systems management</li><li><strong>Joy, Inc. and Chief Joy Officer</strong> principles of people-centered workplaces</li><li><strong>Inner Development Goals</strong> and their emphasis on emotional and societal transformation</li></ul><p><strong>💡 What You Can Say to Her</strong></p><p>“You’re seeing the sickness of the world—and that’s a gift. But complaining about it every day is like breathing in smoke without ever clearing the air. You already hold the medicine: your sensitivity, your systems thinking, your emotional clarity, and your music.<br />So here’s the question to sit with:<br /><strong>How can I begin healing the systems around me—one song, one circle, one step at a time?</strong><br />That’s where your confidence, income, and energy will return. Not by fixing it all. But by starting with something small and real.”</p><p>Would you like a short 1-pager for her that reframes this core problem into a mission statement she can own—and use to guide her career, CV, or outreach messages?</p><p>Happy to write it.</p>
